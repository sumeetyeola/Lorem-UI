# Lorem-UI

A lightweight and ready-to-use front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

## Installation

To start using the components in your project, copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` to load our CSS.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://loremui-library.netlify.app/css/components.css"
/>
```

Some of our components require the use of Javascript to function. Place our script right before the closing `</body>` tag to enable them.

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://loremui-library.netlify.app/scripts/script.js"
></script>
```
